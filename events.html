<p>The Virginia Tech Gesta Latina, a Hispanic-Latino achievement ceremony, has been an annual tradition since 2005. More than 250 Hispanic/Latino students have been recognized during this special occasion. The event celebrates the accomplishments of Hispanic/Latino undergraduate and graduate students. Participating students receive a commemorative stole, which can be worn with their academic regalia. Gesta (which has the same meaning in Latin and Spanish) means deeds or accomplishments.</p>

<p>The Virginia Tech Gesta Latina is open to everyone. A traditional dinner reception immediately follows the ceremony, which is organized by the Virginia Tech Hispanic/Latino Faculty Caucus with support from the Latino Association of Student Organizations.</p>
