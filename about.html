<h1 class="sub">About Caucus</h1>
<p>The Hispanic and Latino Faculty Staff Caucus (the Hispanic Caucus) collaborates with the University Administration for the recruitment and retention of Hispanic/Latino faculty, staff, and students.</p>

<p>We also support community efforts that commemorate the diverse cultures in this region. The Caucus aims to enhance the quality of education and life for all faculty, staff and students at Virginia Tech and residents in surrounding communities.</p>

<p>The Caucus was first formed in late Spring 2002, and began meeting in Fall 2002. The Caucus has a representative on the University-wide Commission on Equal Opportunity and Diversity, and is involved with the Multicultural Fellows program. The Caucus also works closely with the various Hispanic/Latino student organizations.</p>

<p>We also organize the Virginia Tech Gesta Latina, a Hispanic/Latino achievement ceremony, that recognizes Hispanic/Latin@ graduating students This event takes place in May, before university commencement ceremonies.</p>
