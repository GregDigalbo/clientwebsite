<ol>
<li>Identify Hispanic/Latino faculty, staff, graduate students, and allies at Virginia Tech and encourage their participation in the Caucus. The purpose here is to build our ranks and ensure wider representation.</li><br/>

<li>To increase Caucus participation in undergraduate student affairs. Examples include working closely with LASO and the TechDREAMers, and the creation of undergraduate research symposiums and opportunities.</li><br/>

<li>Mentoring: Create tangible networks of mentoring among different members of the Caucus. Create a system of assigned mentors for all new members to the community. Mentoring should also extend to the Latino graduate student community.</li><br/>

<li>Recruitment: Identify current statistics regarding constituents in the different roles (faculty, staff, students) in the institution. Work to increase these numbers through partnering with relevant organizations and offices on campus.</li><br/>

<li>Retention: Ensure that VT provides a competitive package and benefits for all Caucus members. Ensure that issues of salary equity for current members is at the forefront of any retention efforts made by the university.</li><br/>

<li>Space: Work towards the creation of a dedicated Center for Hispanic/Latino Affairs, which has been part of the InclusiveVT conversation.</li><br/>

<li>Endowed Chair: Work towards creating an endowed chair in Hispanic/Latino Studies.</li><br/>
